Thoughts
--------
Many people are happy with the photo management features in Lightroom and Picasa and similar software, and never rename the original files.  
The drawback, in my opinion, is you become quickly tied to that program as the effort invested into that catalog is only 
paid back when you continue to use that program and only that one.

Giving a photo or video file a meaningful name means I, and anyone, can find it easily using any search method on the computer.  
Photos and videos sent to others preserve the information in the name.

Thoughts
--------
Many people are happy with the photo management features in Lightroom and Picasa and similar software, and never rename the original files.  Excellent programs of course, but the drawback, in my opinion, is you are then tied to that program since the effort invested into the catalog is paid back if you continue to use that program and only that one.

A photo or video or any file with a meaningful name can be found within a managed library or by standard file searches.  Photos and videos sent to others preserve the information in the name.
